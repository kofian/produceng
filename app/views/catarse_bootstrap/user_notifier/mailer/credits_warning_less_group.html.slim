br/
| In order to further simplify the process of repayments, 
'  from 10/11 #{link_to 'there will be no more credits on ProduceRun', 'http://support.producerun.com', target: '__blank'}. That's why we came here to talk to you.
br/
br/
| So we check , you've got to use part of their claims , but still has #{user.display_credits} this way.
br/
br/
| It's like you thought that note or coin lost in the pocket of his pants and could give a nice destination for her. :-)
br/
br/
| Hence , so you might think, at least support in the ProduceRun is 10 dollars, what to do then?
br/
br/
| The minimum support is $ 10 yes, but <strong>at√© 10/11</strong> you will be able to support a campaign you believe with the credits you have left.
br/
br/
|To support a project, the process is the same :
br/
br/
| 1 - Choose the project you want to support;
br/
| 2 - Clicking Support this project;
br/
| 3 - Put the value you want to support and select the field confirming that you want to use your credits
br/
| 4 - Click the Review button and perform payment at the bottom of the screen;
br/
| 5 - Ready ! Your support will be confirmed
